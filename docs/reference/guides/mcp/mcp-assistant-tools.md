# MCP Assistant Tools Integration User Guide

## Overview

MCP (Model Context Protocol) Assistant Tools Integration allows your AI assistants to dynamically access and use tools from configured MCP servers. This powerful feature extends your assistants' capabilities beyond their base training, enabling them to:

- Access real-time data from external APIs
- Perform complex calculations and computations
- Interact with databases and file systems
- Execute custom business logic
- Integrate with third-party services

## How MCP Tools Work with Assistants

### The Integration Process

1. **Tool Discovery**: Assistants automatically discover available tools from accessible MCP servers
2. **Dynamic Loading**: Tools are loaded on-demand when assistants need specific capabilities
3. **Intelligent Selection**: Assistants choose appropriate tools based on user requests
4. **Secure Execution**: All tool calls are executed with proper authentication and access controls
5. **Result Integration**: Tool results are seamlessly integrated into assistant responses

### Types of MCP Servers Available to Assistants

Your assistants can access tools from three types of MCP servers:

1. **System-Wide Servers**: Managed by administrators, available to all users
2. **Personal Servers**: Your private servers with custom tools and credentials
3. **Instance Servers**: Shared within your organization or team instance

## Setting Up MCP Tools for Assistants

- **Rate Limiting**: Configure usage limits for expensive or rate-limited tools
- **Error Handling**: Define behavior when tools fail or are unavailable

### Step 4: Configure Tool Access Scope

#### User Context Scoping

MCP tools are automatically scoped based on your access permissions:

- **Personal Servers**: Only your private MCP servers are accessible
- **System Servers**: System-wide servers are available based on your role
- **Instance Servers**: Team/organization servers you have access to

#### Permission Management

- **Read-Only Tools**: Tools that only retrieve information
- **Write Operations**: Tools that modify data (require explicit permission)
- **Administrative Tools**: Tools for system management (admin users only)
- **External API Tools**: Tools that make external service calls

### Step 5: Test MCP Tool Integration

After configuration, test your assistant's MCP tool access:

1. **Tool Discovery Test**: Verify the assistant can see available tools
2. **Sample Queries**: Send test messages that should trigger tool usage
3. **Error Handling**: Test behavior when tools fail or are unavailable
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Check response times and success rates

## Using Assistants with MCP Tools

### Natural Language Tool Invocation

Your assistants will automatically use MCP tools when appropriate. Users don't need to explicitly request tool usage - the assistant intelligently determines when tools are needed.

#### Example Interactions

**Weather Information (using weather API MCP tool):**
- User: "What's the weather like in San Francisco?"
- Assistant uses MCP weather tool → Returns current conditions

**Data Retrieval (using database MCP tool):**
- User: "Show me sales data for last quarter"
- Assistant uses MCP database tool → Queries and formats results

**File Operations (using file system MCP tool):**
- User: "Create a summary report from the latest data"
- Assistant uses MCP file tools → Reads data, generates report

### Tool Chain Execution

Advanced assistants can chain multiple MCP tools together:

1. **Data Retrieval**: Fetch information using one tool
2. **Processing**: Transform data using computation tools
3. **Storage**: Save results using file or database tools
4. **Notification**: Send updates using communication tools

### Tool Result Integration

MCP tool results are seamlessly integrated into assistant responses:

- **Structured Data**: Tables, lists, and formatted information
- **Visual Elements**: Charts, graphs, and images (when supported)
- **File Attachments**: Documents, reports, and generated files
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live data and streaming information

## Monitoring and Management
