* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the enhancement**
* **Describe the current behavior and expected behavior**

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the style guidelines
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Process

### Setup Development Environment

1. Fork and clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/allspark-template.git
cd allspark-template
```

2. Set up the development environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up
docker-compose exec web rails db:setup
```

3. Create a feature branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

### Code Style

#### Ruby Style Guide

We use RuboCop to enforce Ruby style guidelines:

```bash
# Check your code
bundle exec rubocop

# Auto-fix issues
bundle exec rubocop -a
```

Key conventions:
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Prefer single quotes for strings without interpolation
- Keep methods under 10 lines when possible
- Write descriptive variable and method names
- Add comments for complex logic

#### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use ES6+ features
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`
- Use Stimulus.js for JavaScript behavior
- Keep Stimulus controllers focused and single-purpose

#### CSS/SCSS Style Guide

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Use DaisyUI components when available
- Avoid custom CSS when possible
- Keep component styles in ViewComponents

### Testing

All new features must include tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
rails test

# Run specific test file
rails test test/models/user_test.rb

# Run system tests
rails test:system
```

Test guidelines:
- Write unit tests for models and services
- Write integration tests for controllers
- Write system tests for user workflows
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use fixtures for test data

### Commit Messages

We follow conventional commit messages:

```
type(scope): subject

```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:

```

### Documentation
